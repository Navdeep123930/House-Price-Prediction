# House-Price-Prediction

In this repository I built a model using Tensorflow which can predict the price of a house based on the multiple features.
The Model used a single Dense layers with one neuron architecture.
The model was built based on  multiple features such as number of bedrooms and bathrooms,sqft_lot,grade,sqft_living of house .

The model was fit with both our features and their labels, for a total amount of 30 epochs, separating 20% of the samples as validation set. 
I used mean squared error loss function to know if our model is learning properly  or not.

I applied various Python tools to get a better visual understanding of the data.

This project uses the following software and libraries:

Python

Tensorflow

Keras

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn etc...

Thank You
